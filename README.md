# Welcome to Sandcastle 1.X FAQ
To make the game enjoyable, please read some basic help about the mod.\
Keybinds are listed at the bottom! 


## 1. I joined the game but cannot spawn!

That's because Horde mode is PvE (Player vs Entity) cooperation mode.

To spawn, <b> you must wait for current wave to be finished</b>. 

If You are not sure <b>how long</b> it will take, just ask alive players.

## 2. How do start?

### Player's goal is to survive as long as you can.
Start by getting inside the castle (using ladder), and depending on your gold, buy yourself a weapon.

<b>Don't fight alone versus group</b> if you are new - this is the easiest way to die. Instead, <b>kill enemies one by one.</b>

If you are in trouble (low HP, stuck in a group of enemies) use <b>F1</b> key - it will teleport you to throne room.

<b>F1</b> key works <b>once</b> per wave, and is reset when current wave is over.

At any time, You can use <b>J</b> key to enter AFK zone - you can leave it using <b>J</b> key <b>after current wave</b>.

READ CAREFULLY WHAT YOU ARE BUYING! SOME UPGRADES ARE ONE-TIME USE ONLY! YOU LOOSE IT WHEN DYING!

## 3. How can I buy something? What kind of stuff can I buy?

### You can by using "E" key when looking on the item. Here is a list of what can you buy:
* Weapons (melee, ranged)
* HP upgrades (400hp / 530hp / 650hp)
* HP regeneration upgrades (6hp per second / 9hp per second)
* Weapon damage upgrade (green / blue / red) where red upgrade is the strongest

## 4. I am skeleton, and I lost my weapons!
You are skeleton because you died last wave.

As a skeleton, You must surivive 180 seconds (3 minutes) without dying to get your stuff back.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>If you survive</b>: you will be changed into human again with your <b>weapons back</b>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>If you die</b>: you will <b>loose your weapons</b>
  
## 5. I saw a Jedi with lightsaber / player with lightsaber. Can I have it too?
Lightsabers can be <b>picked up from the ground</b> if Jedi drops it after death. Lightsaber drop chance is <b>10%</b>

## 6. How do I find location of weapons/upgrades?
You can ask alive players about the location. 

You can use <b>0</b> (zero key) to open map which helps to understand key locations.

## 7. Is there a Discord server for this game? I have more questions!
Yes, Discord link is located top of your screen. If it doesn't appear there, here is direct link: [https://discord.gg/QHdm5BA](https://discord.gg/QHdm5BA)
