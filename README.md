# Welcome to Sandcastle 1.X FAQ

Here You will find all questions regarding the mod, gameplayer and related stuff.

## 1. I joined but cannot play!

That's because Horde mode is PvE (Player vs Entity) cooperation mode.
To spawn, <b> you must wait for current wave to be finished</b>. \
If You are not sure how long it will take, just ask alive players.


## 2. How do I play?

### Player's goal is to survive as long as you can.
Start by getting inside the castle, and depending on your gold, buy yourself a weapon. \
<b>Don't fight alone versus group</b> if you are new - this is the easiest way to die. Instead, <b>kill enemies one by one.</b>
